# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

Svelo is an educational project dedicated to making cryptography accessible and understandable. We welcome contributors of all skill levels and backgrounds.

## Our Standards

**Positive behaviors:**
- Being respectful and inclusive
- Welcoming newcomers and answering questions patiently
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what's best for the learning community
- Sharing knowledge freely

**Unacceptable behaviors:**
- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary behavior
- Trolling, insulting comments, or personal attacks
- Publishing others' private information
- Gatekeeping or elitism ("you should already know this")
- Any conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional or educational setting

## Educational Environment

Since Svelo is an educational tool:

- **No question is too basic**: We welcome all skill levels
- **Share resources**: Help others learn by pointing to good references
- **Explain clearly**: When discussing cryptography, remember that not everyone has the same background
- **Encourage experimentation**: This tool is for learning, so mistakes are part of the process

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting the project maintainer. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated.

Project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (GitHub repository, issues, pull requests, discussions) and when representing the project in public spaces.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from common open source community standards, with an emphasis on creating a welcoming educational environment.
